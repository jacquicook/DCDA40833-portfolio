            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>For lab 2, I explored an AI tool from the text category (Chat GPT) and an AI tool from the image generation category (Adobe Firefly). I am already very familiar with and have used Chat GPT in both academic and creative contexts. However, Adobe Firefly was new to me, and this lab provided an opportunity to experiment with an unfamiliar AI tool and assess both its strengths and limitations.</p>

            <h2>Tool 1: Chat GPT</h2>
            <h3>Capabilities</h3>
            <p>ChatGPT excels at generating a lot of content super fast, brainstorming ideas, and explaining complex concepts in an easy way. While playing and testing out the tool, I found it very effective for outlining assignments and offering different ways to phrase or structure content. However, ChatGPT can struggle with factual accuracy and may give you misinformation confidently, which can make it untrustworthy. </p>

            <h3>Appropriate Use</h3>
            <p>ChatGPT works well for initial brainstorming, drafting, and clarification rather than final results. It works well as a collaborative tool that supports human thinking rather than replacing it. Using ChatGPT to generate final submissions without careful review would not be right, as it risks plagiarism and weakens your own thought process.</p>

            <h3>Ethical Considerations</h3>
            <p>Transparency is important when using ChatGPT. It’s necessary to be clear about when AI is used and to always double-check what it is saying. Relying on Chat too much can also take away from developing your own skills, so it is important to only use it when necessary. </p>

            <h2>Tool 2: Adobe Firefly</h2>
            <h3>Capabilities</h3>
            <p>Adobe Firefly focuses on image generation and visual creation, making it a great tool for design inspiration. Even though I have no experience using the tool, I found Firefly accessible and user-friendly. The tool responds well to super detailed prompts, and adjusting wording significantly impacted the final images. While Firefly produces visually appealing photos, it sometimes lacks exactness and realism.</p>

            <h3>Appropriate Use</h3>
            <p>Firefly is best used for creative exploration, mockups, and inspiration, not finalized professional images. It can help generate ideas quickly, but should not replace real images or brand-specific work.</p>

            <h3>Ethical Considerations</h3>
            <p>Adobe Firefly is pretty clear about where its training data comes from, which helps diminish concerns about copyright and ownership. However, there are still questions about originality and how AI-generated images should be credited.  It is important to use the tool carefully and think about when and how its images are used </p>

                <figcaption>This screenshot shows an image generated by Adobe Firefly based on my prompt describing a TCU student working on her DCDA project in a classroom. It demonstrates how Firefly can quickly create visual concepts from detailed text prompts, while also showing some limitations in realism.</figcaption>

            <h2>Broader Reflections</h2>
            <p>Lab 2 helped me gain a better understanding of how AI tools can support but not replace human creativity and critical thinking. In my academic and professional work, I plan to use AI as a helpful tool for brainstorming, experimentation, and efficiency, while still being responsible and transparent. Within the DCDA context, AI has the potential to enhance technical workflows. As AI tools continue to get stronger and better, I will evaluate them by researching how they are trained and whether their use aligns with ethical and academic standards.</p>
