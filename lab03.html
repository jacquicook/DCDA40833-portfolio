            <h2>Critique</h2>
            
            <h3>Information Resolution</h3>
            <p> Edward Tufte defines information resolution as the depth and completeness of the information presented in a visualization.
        In the infographic <em>US Teen Pregnancies Have Halved</em>, the visualization is clear and easy to interpret, showing teen
        birth rates per 1,000 females aged 15–19 from 2008 to 2018 across racial and ethnic groups. The numerical values and percentage
        decreases allow viewers to quickly understand the overall downward trend. However, while the chart communicates outcomes effectively, it lacks contextual depth. The visualization does not visually
        explain the reasons behind the decline, such as access to birth control or sexual education programs. As a result, the chart
        provides strong clarity but limited completeness, offering a snapshot of change without fully supporting deeper understanding.</p>

            <h3>Effects without Causes</h3>
            <p>One of Tufte’s key concerns is the presentation of effects without causes, which applies to this infographic. The chart
        emphasizes declining teen pregnancy rates through steep downward lines and bold percentage reductions, but it does not
        visually incorporate the factors that contributed to these outcomes. Without showing causal elements such as public health initiatives or policy changes, the visualization risks encouraging
        viewers to accept the decline as a standalone success. This separation of results from explanation limits analytical depth
        and reduces the chart’s ability to support critical evaluation.</p>

            <h3>Cherry-Picking</h3>
            <p>The infographic also reflects Tufte’s concern about cherry-picking data. By focusing only on the years 2008 to 2018, the
        visualization highlights a period of improvement while excluding broader historical or recent trends. Viewers are not shown
        how teen pregnancy rates behaved before or after this decade. Also, while the chart presents racial and ethnic breakdowns, it does not have other important dimensions such as geographic
        or international comparisons. This selective framing supports a positive narrative but limits the completeness of the data
        story.</p>

            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>Overall, <em>US Teen Pregnancies Have Halved</em> is a visually effective infographic that clearly communicates a significant
        trend. Its clean design and clear labeling align with Tufte’s principles of clarity and simplicity. However, the visualization
        prioritizes outcomes over explanation, which limits its informational depth.</p>
